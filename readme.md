# RentRovers

My first Laravel project!

During the first couple weeks at the Alacrity Foundation we were taken through a 'boot camp' of development training, to be brought up to speed with building web applications with Laravel. The project I chose to build was a travelling app, aimed at the solo "lone wolf" travellers or even family holidaymakers. 

The main idea behind TravelPal was connecting local, genuine and (most importantly) friendly people with travellers looking to explore whilst saving £££ on expensive tour guides and tourist attractions. It was quite Uber-inspired, in that there are two market users who benefit from using it.  


These instructions assume you have successfully run Laravel projects in the past. Refer to the [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3) for more information to set up Composer etc. 

To build, clone the repo and then run: 

Build Composer dependencies:
`$ composer install`

Build NPM dependencies:
`$ npm install`

Compile NPM dependencies (you may need to install gulp first):
`$ npm i gulp -g`
`$ gulp`

Run it!
`$ php artisan serve`
