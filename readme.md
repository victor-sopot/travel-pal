# RentRovers

My first Laravel project!

These instructions assume you have successfully run Laravel projects in the past. Refer to the [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3) for more information to set up Composer etc. 

To build, clone the repo and then run: 

Build Composer dependencies:
`$ composer install`

Build NPM dependencies:
`$ npm install`

Compile NPM dependencies (you may need to install gulp first):
`$ npm i gulp -g`
`$ gulp`

Run it!
`$ php artisan serve`
